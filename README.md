## Project
Based on the [Pac-Man project](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project2/) developed at UC Berkeley by John DeNero, Dan Klein, Pieter Abbeel, and many others. 
To pass the assignment, **answer question 2 and 3**!

Start by reading through the project description, and test that the code works by executing pacman.py: `python pacman.py`

## Implementation
Test your code with the autograder.py. The autograder will require that your code passes all the tests, so you will always get either 0/5 or 5/5 as the output.
- `python autograder.py -q q2 --no-graphics`
- `python autograder.py -q q3 --no-graphics`
